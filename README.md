## Kobe Bryant's Shot Selection
The First Project is a model built to classify whether Kobe made or missed the shot from a past Kaggle Competition. Using the Logistic Model, I achieved a 0.64771 when I submitted the result (although the competition was closed long time ago).

The 3 main techniques that I used and practised in this Notebook:
1. Groupby()
2. Using ROC and AUC when evaluating the model
3. a little bit of Data Visualization
